# Stock Analysis
Performimg Analysis on Stock Market data to uncover trends.

## Project Overview
  Helping an indiviual who's interested in using data from stocks that are tied with renewable sources or green alternatives with a workbook prepared for him. With a click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset. Now, with more research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although the code worked well for a dozen stocks, it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.
  
### Purpose
  During the analysis, Data has been edited, formatted, and refactored. The dataset was put though code that loops, through the data with ease to collect essential data from a dataset. After that code gets refractored, Which would allow the code to run faster than previously. After that a step-back is taken, into the code for a "clean-up" which conssits of using less lines for Excel to run the code faster & have a set-up that the end-user(Steve) can manuver and create theirs/his own analysis without having to do any work. 

## Analysis & Challenges
  Struggles during the project that presented itself such as roadblocks. Especially reaching a solution in the making of macro functions to carry their duty correctly. Key takeaway from this project are that code has to be correctly written, make sure to "cross your T's & dot your I's", the significance of that saying is, the macros require strict supervision, must be careful in making sure nothing is missing, mispositioned, or extra. With the project at its completion its clear its carries a simple asthetic, but an effective tool for Steve's journey with stocks.
  
### Analysis of 2017 & 2018
 - These images shows a user friendly inteface. with the (Top Green Button) allowing the user to select the year, to retrieve a summary of stock performance for the year. The summary isn't the most user friendly, so in order to allow more digestible data. Formatting button was added (Middle Blue Button). Color was also added with 2 simple colors that convey green as good/stock value growth and red as bad/stock value decline. Finally the (Bottom Red Button) was added to allow user be able to check other years and how those stocks performed, but to do so table must cleared in order to observe the performace of other years.

 - These images shows early set-up that allows developers to track the time it took to run the code. The applicaton of runtime for end-user is that this information allows developers to test DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)principle & compact code, that can be ran fast & efficient on their end.

 - These images shows Run-Time Refractored, DRY principle & compact code applied. As can be seen run-time had a significant reduction. For 2017 by 62% & for 2018 by 83%. These percentage demonstrate success in refactoring in run-time.

### Challenges
 - Many challenges were presented in the analysis. from the start with understanding of proper application of Visual Basic, Half-way through the analysis, with assistance to correct the placement, and be able add macros to sheets. Another issues came with application of "For Loops" but with perssitance it was cleaned, and corrected to allow efficiant & smooth running code.



## Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
 - Advantages: faster running code,comes in handy for the reason that, one doesn't know the Computer/RAM capacity of the End-User, which secures the possiblity of user to acces the information with ease.
 - Disadvantages: longer development time, there is possibility that deadlines to interfere with refactoring, which could potentially lessen the quality script.

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
 - Simply said "Best things in Life take time", if allowed time to develop, the script will be refactored and allow a better product for end-users.
